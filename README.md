# NOROSEC

*NOROSEC is my logbook of forbidden knowledge — documenting research across every frontier of cybersecurity: web, hardware, satellites, RF, car systems, malware, forensics, OSINT, and physical security. No boundaries, no safe zones — only exploration.*

## About

NOROSEC is my personal research hub and knowledge archive. Here I explore **offensive security** in all its forms — from software exploitation to physical red teaming, from reverse engineering malware to hacking satellites and car systems.

This repository serves as both:
- A **portfolio** of my work and experiments
- A **reference library** for other hackers, researchers, and enthusiasts

## Topics Covered

- **Web Exploitation & Bug Bounty**  
- **Hardware & Car Hacking (IoT, CAN Bus, embedded systems)**  
- **Satellite & RF Security (signals, SDR, comms interception)**  
- **Malware Analysis & Reverse Engineering**  
- **Digital Forensics & OSINT**  
- **Physical Red Teaming & Intrusion Techniques**

## Vision

NOROSEC is built on the belief that knowledge should be **free, raw, and uncensored** — empowering hackers and defenders alike to understand the systems that shape our world.
